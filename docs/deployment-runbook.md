## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.1 Toolchain

| Tool | Required version | Check | Install |
|------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Rust | stable ≥ 1.75 | `rustc --version` | `rustup update` |
| WASM target | `wasm32v1-none` | `rustup target list --installed \| grep wasm32v1-none` | `rustup target add wasm32v1-none` |
| Stellar CLI | **25.1.0** (pinned) | `stellar --version` | `cargo install --locked stellar-cli@25.1.0 --features opt` |
| Docker (optional) | any recent | `docker --version` | For reproducible builds: `docker compose run --rm build` |

> The WASM target **must** be `wasm32v1-none`. The legacy `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
> target produces binaries for the wrong Soroban environment and will fail on
> upload or behave incorrectly. `scripts/deploy.sh` enforces this — it builds
> with `--target wasm32v1-none` and warns if stale `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
> artifacts are present.

> **bash 4+ is required.** macOS ships `/bin/bash` 3.2, which does not support
> associative arrays. `scripts/deploy/common.sh` checks the version at startup
> and exits immediately with a clear error and install instructions if bash 3.2
> is detected. Install bash 4+ via Homebrew (`brew install bash`) and invoke
> the script with the full path: `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash scripts/deploy.sh`.

The pinned Stellar CLI version (25.1.0) is the version used in CI and in the
`Dockerfile` (`rust:1.93.0-slim` base). Newer CLI versions may change `stellar
contract upload` / `invoke` flag names — pin to avoid silent breakage.

Recommended `rustc`/`cargo` versions are in `rust-toolchain.toml` if present;
otherwise use the latest stable. The workspace `Cargo.toml` sets
`soroban-sdk = 21.7.7`.

### 1.2 Network Configuration

Add RPC endpoints once (examples show testnet):

```sh
stellar network add testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

stellar network add mainnet \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.stellar.validationcloud.io \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
```

The deploy script reads `NETWORK` (or `STELLAR_NETWORK`) and passes it as
`--network`. Valid values: `testnet`, `mainnet`, `futurenet`, `local`.

### 1.3 Account Funding

The deployer account (`--source`) must exist and hold enough XLM for
contract deploys (≈ 1–2 XLM per contract on testnet; more on mainnet due to
storage rent).

Create and fund on testnet:

```sh
stellar keys generate --default-seed soroban-amm-deployer
stellar keys fund soroban-amm-deployer --network testnet
stellar keys address soroban-amm-deployer  # save this public key
```

On mainnet, fund by sending XLM from an exchange or funded wallet — Friendbot
does not exist on mainnet. Ensure the account has a trustline/pinned funding
before running `scripts/deploy.sh`.

Set:

```sh
export SOURCE_ACCOUNT=soroban-amm-deployer
export NETWORK=testnet          # or mainnet
# Optionally override admin/fee recipient:
export ADMIN_ADDRESS=G...       # defaults to SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY
export FEE_RECIPIENT=G...
```

The script will generate and fund the source key automatically if it does not
exist (testnet only).

### 1.4 Build Before Deploy

```sh
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none
# Or via Make:
make build
# Optimize artifacts (20–40% smaller) — REQUIRED for concentrated_liquidity
# and factory, both of which exceed the 131 072-byte network cap unoptimized:
make optimize
```

The deploy script also builds automatically if any expected artifact is
missing. **Run `make optimize` before deploying** — `scripts/deploy.sh` now
prefers the optimized artifacts under `optimized-artifacts/` when they exist,
and enforces the 131 072-byte network cap before each upload (failing early
with a clear message instead of surfacing `TxSorobanInvalid` from the RPC).

Expected artifacts (18 deployable crates):

```
amm.wasm
token.wasm
factory.wasm
concentrated_liquidity.wasm
governance.wasm
staking.wasm
twap_consumer.wasm
oracle_adapters.wasm
twal_consumer.wasm
oracle_aggregator.wasm
router.wasm
batch_router.wasm
dex_aggregator.wasm
batch_auction.wasm
cl_position_nft.wasm
reserve_manager.wasm
incentive_campaigns.wasm
pol_vesting.wasm
v2_to_v3_migration.wasm
```

(`amm-sdk` and `amm-fuzz` are libraries, not deployable.)

---

## 2. Deployment Order & Dependency Reasoning

The protocol is a DAG — each contract's `initialize` takes addresses of
contracts that must already exist and be initialized. Deploying out of order
fails with `NotInitialized` or missing-hash errors.

**Step-by-step table:**

| # | Contract(s) | Depends on | Why this order |
|---|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Token A, Token B, Reward Token** | None | Standalone SEP-41 tokens. All pools and staking need them as underlying assets. Created first so factory pools can reference them. |
| 2 | **WASM uploads** (`token.wasm`, `amm.wasm`, `concentrated_liquidity.wasm`) | Tokens built | Factory's `initialize` requires pre-uploaded WASM hashes (`amm_wasm_hash`, `token_wasm_hash`). Hashes are 32-byte SHA-256 of the WASM; they must be `stellar contract upload`ed before factory init. CL hash is registered afterward via `set_cl_wasm_hash`. |
| 3 | **Factory** | WASM hashes + admin | Deploys and owns pool creation. Single entry point for V2 and CL pools. Sets `DefaultFeeTier=2` (30 bps). Must exist before any pool. |
| 4 | **Pools via Factory** (`create_pool`, `create_cl_pool`) | Factory + Token A/B | Factory deploys LP token (admin = pool) and AMM pool in one tx, enforces pair uniqueness, registers in `Pool(token_a,token_b) → pool`. CL pool needs `initial_tick` and `tick_spacing` derived from fee tier. Pools are **never** deployed directly — the factory path guarantees `Pool → LpToken` linkage and indexing for `dex_aggregator`. |
| 5 | **Governance** | AMM pool + LP token | LP-weighted voting: `balance_at` snapshots need the LP token's checkpoint history. Governance becomes the LP token's `locker` so `vote` can lock shares during the voting window. Factory wiring: if pools were created with a `governance_wasm_hash`, factory already deployed governance; otherwise deploy here. |
| 6 | **Oracle Aggregator** | Admin only | Standalone median-price aggregator over fresh, agreeing sources. No pool dependency for deployment, but pools can later `set_oracle` to wire it. Deploy early so pools can be configured with it immediately after. |
| 7 | **TWAP Consumer / TWAL Consumer** | Keeper (admin) + pools | Read `get_price_cumulative` / `get_liquidity_cumulative` from pools and store snapshots. Initialized with a `keeper` address authorized to call `save_snapshot`. No pool required at init, but they run after the pools so `deploy.sh` can register the AMM and CL pools with the TWAL consumer (`add_tracked_pool`) straight away. |
| 8 | **Staking** | LP token + Reward token + admin | Users stake LP tokens for reward-token emissions. Boost-lock config (`min_boost=1x`, `max_boost=2.5x`, `min_lock=7d`, `max_lock=4y`) is set at init. Needs LP token address to transfer stakes. |
| 9 | **Incentive Campaigns** | Governance | Governance creates time-based campaigns with `reward_rate * duration <= funding`. Needs governance address so only governance can call `create_campaign`. |
| 10 | **POL Vesting** | Governance + Treasury | Linear vesting of POL LP tokens between `cliff_ledger` and `end_ledger`. Governance creates/revokes, treasury receives revoked tokens. |
| 11 | **Reserve Manager** | Governance + Factory | Off-chain gate `check_reserves(pool)` — reads `get_info()` and compares to `min_reserve` per pair. No AMM hook (see issue #518); bots/dashboards call it before migration. |
| 12 | **Router** | Factory | Multi-hop `swap_exact_in` across pools discovered via `factory.get_pool`. |
| 13 | **DEX Aggregator** | Factory + Admin + CL pools | Cross-venue best-execution router over AMM + CL pools. Initialized with `MaxHops=4`, `MAX_CL_POOLS=50`, `CL_FEE_TIERS=[30,100,500]`. CL pools must be `register_cl_pool`ed before they participate in routing. |
| 14 | **Batch Auction** | Admin + `batch_window_secs` | Collects orders for `batch_window_secs` then `settle_batch` atomically. Needs no pool at init — validates `pool_matches_pair` at `submit_order`. |
| 15 | **Batch Router** | Factory (+ Batch Auction) | Atomic batch of swaps/liquidity ops resolved through the factory. Deployed right after the auction it fronts, so a deployment never ends up with an auction and no router. |
| 16 | **CL Position NFT** | CL pool | ERC-721 receipt for CL positions. Only `cl_pool` may `mint`/`burn`. After deploy, `cl_pool.set_position_nft(nft)` wires it so positions automatically mint an NFT. |
| 17 | **V2 → V3 Migration** | V2 pool + V3 pool + admin | Burns V2 LP shares and mints a CL position in one tx. Verifies `token_a/token_b` match or reverts `TokenMismatch`. |

Within `scripts/deploy.sh` these steps are executed by `deploy_tokens`, `deploy_factory`,
`deploy_pools`, `deploy_governance`, etc., each respecting `--only`/`--skip`.

## 3. Per-Contract Initialization Parameters

Every parameter lists: **what it is**, **recommended value**, **rationale**, and
**what happens if it is wrong or out of bounds**.

### 3.1 Token (`token`)

| Param | Type | Recommended | Rationale | If wrong |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `admin` | Address | AMM pool address (when used as LP token) or deployer for asset tokens | Only `admin` can `mint`/`burn`. For LP tokens, the pool must be admin so `add_liquidity` can mint shares. | If asset token admin = pool, anyone adding liquidity could inflate supply. If LP token admin ≠ pool, `add_liquidity` reverts. |
| `name` | String | `"AMM LP Token #N"` (auto) / `"Soroban AMM Token A"` | Human-readable; no on-chain effect. | None, but confusing UX. |
| `symbol` | String | `"ALP0"` / `"SAMA"` | DEX display; max ~12 chars recommended. | None. |
| `decimals` | u32 | `7` (Stellar default) | Matches SEP-41 and most Stellar assets. | Swaps/amounts mis-scaled by 10^(decError). |

**Storage lock / checkpoints:** `MAX_CHECKPOINTS=1024`, TTL `MIN_TTL=120960` / `BUMP_TO=2419200`. No init param — baked in. Governance snapshots query `balance_at(ledger)`; if history is truncated, queries before retained history revert rather than returning a bogus 0.

### 3.2 AMM Pool (`amm`) — created via `factory.create_pool`

Pools are not initialized directly in the full-protocol flow. Factory's
`create_pool` calls `amm.initialize` with:

| Param | Recommended | Rationale | If wrong |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `admin` | `gov` if governance deployed, else factory `admin` | Governance-administered pools allow on-chain fee changes; factory-admin pools are upgradable centrally. | Wrong admin = fees/upgrades paused or controlled by wrong key. |
| `token_a/b` | `TOKEN_A_CONTRACT_ID`, `TOKEN_B_CONTRACT_ID` (normalized order) | Pair uniqueness is enforced by factory. | Duplicate pool reverts `PoolAlreadyExists (3)`. |
| `lp_token` | Factory-deployed LP token (auto) | Factory generates salt `n*3` and `n*3+1` deterministically. | Manual LP token breaks factory `get_lp_token` lookup and `dex_aggregator` discovery. |
| `fee_bps` | `30` (0.30% = Medium/fee_tier 2) | See fee-tier table below. 0.30% is the Uniswap-v2 default, good for most pairs. Stablecoin pairs may prefer `1` or `5`. | `>10000` reverts `InvalidFeeBps (2)`. `0` = no fees (LPs earn nothing). `>=10000` undercuts all LP incentive. |
| `fee_recipient` | Factory contract address | Factory becomes `fee_recipient` so `sweep_fees` can collect protocol fees. | Fees accrue to wrong address; `sweep_fees` no-ops. |
| `protocol_fee_bps` | `0` (disabled at deploy) | Must be `< fee_bps` (LPs must retain some of each swap). Enabling later via `set_protocol_fee` is safe after governance review. | `protocol_fee_bps >= fee_bps` reverts `InvalidFeeBps`. `protocol_fee_bps == fee_bps` would route 100% to protocol, starving LPs (guarded by M-02 fix). |
| `flash_loan_fee_bps` | Defaults to `fee_bps` if using `initialize`; custom via `initialize_with_flash_loan_fee` | Flash-loan fee may be lower than swap fee for comptime arbitrage, but should not be 0 or under-collateralized borrows are free. | Diverging too low = underpriced borrowing risk. Too high = arbitrage unprofitable, reduces volume. |

**Fee tiers (factory):**

| Tier | `fee_tier` | `fee_bps` | Use |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| VeryLow | 0 | 1 (0.01%) | Stablecoin/stablecoin (like USDC/USDT) |
| Low | 1 | 5 (0.05%) | Correlated pairs |
| **Medium** | **2** | **30 (0.30%)** | **Volatile pairs (default)** |
| High | 3 | 100 (1.00%) | Exotic/illiquid pairs |

**AMM defaults (not init params but tuned via setters):**

| Setting | Default | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------|
| `LpRebateBps` | 0 | 0–5000 (0–50% of protocol fee back to LPs) | Set via `set_lp_rebate`. 5000 = half the protocol cut is returned to reserves, softening LP loss. |
| `CircuitBreakerThresholdBps` | 5000 (50%) | 5000 (testnet) / 3000–5000 (mainnet) | Spot price deviation in one ledger that auto-pauses the pool. Lower = safer but more false positives on volatile pairs. |
| `CircuitBreakerCooldown` | 600s (10 min) | 600–1800s | Must elapse before `try_circuit_breaker_recovery`. Shorter = faster recovery, longer = more time for governance review. |
| `MaxOracleDeviationBps` | 500 (5%) | 500 | Spot vs. oracle price check in `swap`. Disabled until `set_oracle` is called. |

### 3.3 Concentrated Liquidity (`concentrated_liquidity`) — via `factory.create_cl_pool`

| Param | Recommended | Rationale | If wrong |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Governance or multisig for `pause`/`set_protocol_fee`/`upgrade`. | Central admin can pause CL pool; wrong key = denial-of-service. |
| `token_a/b` | Same as V2 pair | Allows parallel V2 and V3 liquidity on same pair at different fee tiers. Triplet `(token_a, token_b, fee_bps)` is unique. | Duplicate triplet reverts `ClPoolAlreadyExists (4)`. |
| `fee_bps` | `30`, `100`, or `500` (routed tiers) | Factory maps `5→spacing 1`, `30→10`, `100→60`, `500→200`. Custom fees use `1` spacing. | `>10000` reverts `InvalidFeeBps`. Non-tiered values work but may not be routed by `dex_aggregator` (`CL_FEE_TIERS=[30,100,500]`). |
| `initial_tick` | `0` (price 1:1) for a new pair with no price history; else current mid price tick | `tick = log_{1.0001}(price)`. Range `[-887272, 887272]`. | Out of range reverts `TickOutOfRange (4)`. Wrong initial price = immediate arbitrage loss. |
| `tick_spacing` | Derived from fee (see above) | Enforced — ticks must be multiples of spacing, else `TickNotAligned (13)`. | Wrong spacing = mispriced ranges and wasted gas on invalid positions. |

### 3.4 Factory (`factory`)

| Param | Recommended | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` (deployer or multisig) | Becomes the `fee_recipient` for all factory-created AMM pools and authorizes `upgrade`, `set_cl_wasm_hash`, `set_treasury`, etc. |
| `amm_wasm_hash` | SHA-256 of `amm.wasm` (uploaded) | Must be uploaded via `stellar contract upload` before `initialize`. Changing it later via `update_wasm_hashes` only affects future pools. |
| `token_wasm_hash` | SHA-256 of `token.wasm` | Same. |
| `cl_wasm_hash` | After init via `set_cl_wasm_hash` | Required before `create_cl_pool`; otherwise reverts `ClWasmNotSet (5)`. |
| `DefaultFeeTier` | `2` (30 bps) | Set automatically by `initialize`; tunable via `set_default_fee_tier(0–3)`. |
| `PermissionlessMode` | `false` initially | When `true`, anyone can `create_pool` by paying `PoolCreationFee` in `FeeToken`, rate-limited by `RateLimitLedgers`. Keep `false` until spam policy is decided. |
| `PoolCreationFee` / `FeeToken` | `0` (unset) | If permissionless, set via `set_pool_creation_fee`. Recommended: 1–10 XLM equivalent to deter spam without deterring legitimate pools. |
| `RateLimitLedgers` | `1` (default) | Minimum ledgers between creations per address. Increase under spam attack. |

### 3.5 Governance (`governance`)

| Param | Recommended | Rationale | If wrong |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Authorizes `set_min_proposer_stake_bps`, `set_veto_multisig`, etc. | Wrong admin = governance parameter changes controlled by attacker. |
| `amm_pool` | `AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID` | Proposal execution calls `amm.update_fee` / `set_protocol_fee`. | Wrong pool = proposals change fees on the wrong market. |
| `lp_token` | `LP_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID` | Voting power = `balance_at(snapshot_ledger)`. Lock via `lp_token.lock`. | Wrong token = voting power zero or unrelated token, quorum never met. |
| `voting_period_secs` | `604800` (7 days) | 7 days is standard for on-chain governance (enough for discussion, not so long that parameter fixes stall). | `0` or negative rejected `InvalidVotingPeriod (2)`. Too short (<1 day) = voters miss the window; too long (>30 days) = parameters cannot respond to crises. |
| `timelock_secs` | `172800` (2 days) | Delay between `voting ends` and `execute()` — lets users exit before a contentious fee change takes effect. | Too short = no exit window; too long = urgent fixes (e.g. pausing a broken pool) are blocked — use `cancel_proposal` path or direct `pause` instead. |
| `quorum_bps` | `1000` (10%) | Of total LP supply at snapshot. 10% balances liveness (quorum reachable) vs. security (small coalition cannot pass). | `0` or `>10000` rejected `InvalidQuorumBps (4)`. Too low = governance capture; too high = proposals never pass. |
| `min_proposer_stake_bps` | `100` (1%) | Of total LP supply. Prevents spam proposals while letting genuine LPs participate. | Too high = only whales can propose; too low = proposal spam. |
| `veto_multisig` | Unset initially; set via `set_veto_multisig` if needed | Within `VETO_WINDOW_SECS=86400` (24h) after voting ends, the veto multisig can `veto()` a passing proposal. | Without veto, a flash-governance attack cannot be stopped. With an overly powerful veto multisig, governance is centrally controlled — keep threshold ≥ 3-of-5 multisig. |

### 3.6 Staking (`staking`)

| Param | Recommended | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `lp_token` | `LP_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID` | Token users stake. |
| `reward_token` | `REWARD_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID` | Token distributed via `accumulated_rewards_per_share` (1e18 scale). |
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Calls `add_rewards` / `update_rewards`. |
| `min_boost_scaled` | `10000` (1x) | Default; change via `initialize_with_boost_config`. |
| `max_boost_scaled` | `25000` (2.5x) | 2.5x at max lock. Higher (e.g. 4x) centralizes rewards to long lockers. |
| `min_lock_duration_secs` | `604800` (7 days) | Below this, boost = 1x (`stake` path). |
| `max_lock_duration_secs` | `126144000` (4 years) | At this duration, boost = `max_boost_scaled`. Linear interpolation in between. |
| `ConfigMaxRewardPoolBalance` | `0` (no cap) | If set, `claim` stops when pool depleted. |

Rewards are added via `add_rewards(admin, amount)` which `transfer`s reward tokens into the staking contract; use a funding account with enough balance. Circuit breaker `Paused` / `EmergencyMode` are separate from the AMM breaker.

### 3.7 Incentive Campaigns (`incentive_campaigns`)

| Param | Recommended | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `governance` | `GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID` | Only governance can `create_campaign`, `set_campaign_rate`. |
| Campaign `reward_rate * duration <= funding_amount` | Enforced | Prevents underfunded campaigns. |
| `PRECISION` | `1e12` (fixed) | Per-second accumulator to prevent flash-deposit theft (fix for #425). |

### 3.8 POL Vesting (`pol_vesting`)

| Param | Recommended | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `governance` | `GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID` | Only governance can create/revoke schedules. |
| `treasury` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` or multisig treasury | Receives tokens when a schedule is `revoke`d. |
| `start_ledger`, `cliff_ledger`, `end_ledger` | `end > cliff >= start` | Linear vesting: `releasable = total * (ledger - cliff) / (end - cliff)` after cliff. Before cliff, `release` returns `NothingToRelease (5)`. |

### 3.9 Reserve Manager (`reserve_manager`)

| Param | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `governance` | `GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID` |
| `factory` | `FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` |
| `min_reserve` per pair | Set via `set_min_reserve(token_a,token_b, min_a, min_b)`. Off-chain gate — AMM withdrawals are **not** blocked on-chain (issue #518). Keep `min_reserve` at ~5–10% of expected TVL so dashboards alert before pools drain. |

### 3.10 Oracle Aggregator (`oracle_aggregator`)

| Param | Recommended | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Registers/removes sources via `add_source`/`remove_source`. |
| `max_staleness_seconds` | `3600` (1 hour) | Sources older than this are ignored. For stablecoins, 300s is tighter; for illiquid pairs, 3600s avoids flapping confidence. Rejects `0` (`InvalidStaleness (7)`). |
| `max_deviation_bps` | `500` (5%) | Fresh quotes outside median ±5% are dropped as `deviant` and not counted toward `confidence`. Tighter (e.g. 200) = more sensitive, may reject legitimate cross-venue spread. Looser (e.g. 1000) = attacker can pull median halfway before being flagged. |

Needs `MIN_VALID_SOURCES=2` fresh, agreeing sources to return non-zero confidence.

### 3.11 TWAP / TWAL Consumers

| Param | Recommended | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `keeper` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Authorized to `save_snapshot(pool)` / `save_cl_snapshot`. Run a cron (e.g. every 60s) calling `save_snapshot`. |
| `SNAPSHOT_TTL_LEDGERS` | `120960` (~7 days at 5s/ledger) | Snapshots evicted after TTL — keeper must snapshot frequently enough that `get_twap_price(pool, window)` can always find `now_ts - window`. |

When `ADMIN_ADDRESS` is the deploying account, `deploy.sh` also registers the
deployed AMM pool (`Amm`) and CL pool (`Cl`) with the TWAL consumer. With a
separate keeper it prints the `add_tracked_pool` commands for the keeper to run.

TWAP is `(cum_a_now - cum_a_then) / window` scaled by `1_000_000`. CL path uses `get_tick_cumulative`. TWAL differences `active_liquidity * elapsed`.

### 3.12 Router / Batch Router / DEX Aggregator / Batch Auction

| Contract | Param | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Router** | `factory` | `FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` | Discovers pools via `get_pool`. No admin param. |
| **Batch Router** | `factory` | `FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` | `MAX_BATCH_OPS=200`. No `DeadlineExpired` per leg — overall deadline enforced by caller. |
| **DEX Aggregator** | `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Controls `register_cl_pool`, `set_max_hops`. |
|  | `factory` | `FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` |  |
|  | `max_hops` | `4` (default) | 4-hop paths are exhaustive enough without excessive gas. |
| **Batch Auction** | `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` |  |
|  | `batch_window_secs` | `60` | Orders collected for 60s, then `settle_batch` executes atomically. Lower = more latency-sensitive, higher = more orders per batch but slower fills. Max orders default `50`, ceiling `200`. |

### 3.13 CL Position NFT (`cl_position_nft`)

| Param | Recommended | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | Can `set_ttl_params`. |
| `cl_pool` | `CL_POOL_CONTRACT_ID` | Only this pool may `mint`/`burn` NFTs. After init, call `cl_pool.set_position_nft(nft)` to wire it so `mint_position` auto-mints an NFT. |
| TTL | `DEFAULT_MIN_TTL=518400` (~30d), `DEFAULT_BUMP_TO=3110400` (~180d) | Bump on every read/write to prevent position-NFT eviction for long-lived positions. |

### 3.14 V2 → V3 Migration (`v2_to_v3_migration`)

| Param | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `admin` | `ADMIN_ADDRESS` |
| `v2_pool` | `AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID` |
| `v3_pool` | `CL_POOL_CONTRACT_ID` |

Verifies `token_a/token_b` match in either order or reverts `TokenMismatch`. The
migration mints the CL position directly for the LP and maps token amounts into
the V3 pool's order. Sentinel ticks `i32::MIN`/`MAX` derive bounds from
`current_tick ± width`, round outward to `tick_spacing`, and clamp to the usable
CL tick range. Explicit ticks must already be aligned. Configure the two deposit
minimums in V3 token order; the result reports actual deposits, LP-held
leftovers, final ticks, and the optional position NFT token ID.

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification

> **Initialization window:** `token::initialize` performs no authorization
> check — it only checks that the contract is not already initialized. Between
> the deploy transaction and the initialize transaction there is a window in
> which a third party could call `initialize` first and set themselves as admin.
> `scripts/deploy/token.sh` closes this window by calling `initialize` in the
> immediately following transaction and then asserting the admin with
> `verify_token`, which now fails fatally on a mismatch. Factory-deployed pools
> are not affected (factory deploys and initializes in one invocation).

A deployment that "succeeded" (zero exit code) but left a contract
uninitialized costs the most to debug later. Run these checks manually or rely
on the script's built-in verification — every `invoke` in the script is
followed by a read-back.

### 4.1 Automated verification (built into `scripts/deploy.sh`)

After each `initialize`, the script reads state and asserts:

| Contract | Verification call | Asserts |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Token A/B/Reward | `admin` | `admin == $SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY`; mismatch is **fatal** — indicates a front-run |
| Factory | `get_pool_count`, `get_pools` | Hashes registered, count readable; `creation_paused == false` (unless paused) |
| AMM Pool (via factory) | `get_info` | `token_a/b == expected`, `fee_bps == 30`, `total_shares == 0`, `admin == gov or factory_admin` |
| LP Token | `admin` | `admin == AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID` |
| CL Pool | `current_tick` / `get_pool_state` | Returns `initial_tick` |
| Governance | `get_params` | `amm_pool == AMM_POOL`, `lp_token == LP_TOKEN`, `voting_period == 604800` |
| LP locker | `locker` on LP token | `locker == GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID` |
| Staking | `get_pool_info` | `lp_token == LP_TOKEN`, `reward_token == REWARD_TOKEN` |
| Oracle Aggregator | `get_sources` / `get_admin` | `admin == ADMIN_ADDRESS` |
| TWAP Consumer | `get_keeper` | `keeper == ADMIN_ADDRESS` |
| TWAL Consumer | `get_keeper`, `is_tracked` | `keeper == ADMIN_ADDRESS`; each registered pool reports tracked |
| Router | `get_factory` (if exposed) | `factory == FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` |
| Batch Router | `simulate_batch([])` | Returns `[]`. There is no factory getter; the call loads the stored factory, so it only succeeds once `initialize` has run |
| DEX Aggregator | `get_factory` / `get_admin` | matches |
| Batch Auction | `get_admin` / `get_batch_window` | matches |
| CL Position NFT | `get_admin` / `next_token_id` | `admin == ADMIN_ADDRESS` |
| POL Vesting | `get_governance` | `governance == GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID` |
| Reserve Manager | `get_governance` | `governance == GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID` |

For most contracts, failure prints `[deploy][warn]` but does not abort — review
the log and re-run with `--force` after fixing the cause. **Token admin
verification is an exception**: a mismatch is treated as a fatal error and
aborts the deploy, because it indicates the contract was front-run between
deploy and initialize. See §1 for notes on the initialization window.
The Batch Router and TWAL Consumer steps are also strict: a failed
`initialize` or read-back aborts the run without recording the step as done,
so a re-run retries it.

### 4.2 Manual verification (operator checklist)

Run these after `scripts/deploy.sh` completes (or after any `stellar contract
invoke`):

```sh
# Source the persisted env
source .soroban-amm.deploy.env

# 1. Factory live and hashes registered
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK --source $SOURCE_ACCOUNT -- get_pool_count
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- get_pool --token_a $TOKEN_A_CONTRACT_ID --token_b $TOKEN_B_CONTRACT_ID

# 2. Pool info matches expectations
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- get_info
# Check: token_a == TOKEN_A_CONTRACT_ID, token_b == TOKEN_B_CONTRACT_ID,
#        fee_bps == 30, protocol_fee_bps == 0, admin is governance or ADMIN_ADDRESS

# 3. LP token admin is the pool
stellar contract invoke --id $LP_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID -- admin
# Must equal $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID

# 4. CL pool at expected tick
stellar contract invoke --id $CL_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- current_tick
# Must be 0 (or whatever initial_tick you passed)

# 5. Governance points at correct pool/LP
stellar contract invoke --id $GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID -- get_params

# 6. LP token locker is governance
stellar contract invoke --id $LP_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID -- locker
# Must equal $GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID

# 7. Oracle aggregator admin
stellar contract invoke --id $ORACLE_AGGREGATOR_CONTRACT_ID -- get_admin

# 8. TWAP consumer keeper
stellar contract invoke --id $TWAP_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ID -- get_keeper

# 9. Staking pool info
stellar contract invoke --id $STAKING_CONTRACT_ID -- get_pool_info

# 10. Full address dump
cat .soroban-amm.deploy.env
```

If any read returns `AlreadyInitialized`, `NotInitialized`, or an empty value,
re-run the relevant step with `--only <contract> --force` or invoke the
`initialize` manually.

### 4.3 End-to-end smoke test

The repo ships `scripts/e2e.sh` — it deploys fresh contracts (or reuses the
deploy helpers), mints tokens, adds liquidity, swaps, and removes liquidity,
asserting reserves and swap output are within expected bounds:

```sh
bash scripts/e2e.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failed assertion; prints [PASS]/[FAIL] summary
```

The flows live in `scripts/e2e/`. The shared flows (`v2`, `factory`, `cl`,
`governance`, `staking`) run against the addresses `deploy.sh` persists. The
self-contained flows (`token`, `router`, `dex_aggregator`,
`oracle_aggregator`, `cl_position_nft`, `pol_vesting`, `twap_consumer`)
deploy their own instances and can be run one at a time without a full
deployment, e.g. `bash scripts/e2e/router.sh`. Select flows with
`--only`/`--skip` (see `bash scripts/e2e/run.sh --help`); the self-contained
flows fund extra signers through friendbot, so they target testnet.

Run this against the same `NETWORK` and `SOURCE_ACCOUNT` after a deployment
to confirm the core path is healthy. For a production deployment, consider a
testnet run before targeting mainnet.

To tell a network or funding problem apart from a real failure before
spending a deployment on it, run the preflight first:

```sh
SOURCE_ACCOUNT=<identity> bash scripts/e2e/preflight.sh
# Exits 75 on an infrastructure problem: unhealthy RPC, friendbot rate limit,
# or a missing/underfunded account (re-created via friendbot after a reset)
```

CI runs the same preflight and suite nightly, on relevant pushes to `main` and
on each release (`.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml`); see
`.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` for how its failures are reported.

## 5. Upgrade Procedure

Contracts are upgradeable via `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` (or factory's
`update_wasm_hashes` for future pools). Instance storage is preserved; only
bytecode is replaced. **Storage layout is immutable** — changing `DataKey`
variants or types without a migration bricks the contract.

Two signatures exist:

| Contract | Entrypoint | Authorized by |
|---|---|---|
| `amm`, `factory`, `token` | `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` | stored `admin` (`require_auth`) |
| `governance`, `concentrated_liquidity`, `oracle_aggregator`, `staking` | `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` | `admin` must equal the stored admin **and** `require_auth` — see §5.5 |

### 5.1 Prerequisites

1. The new WASM must already be uploaded: `stellar contract upload --wasm
   target/wasm32v1-none/release/<contract>.wasm --network $NETWORK --source
   $SOURCE_ACCOUNT` → note the printed `hash`.
2. The caller must be the stored `admin` (or governance, if the pool is
   governance-controlled) — `require_auth()` is enforced.
3. Verify the new binary locally: `cargo build --release --target
   wasm32v1-none`, `stellar contract optimize --wasm ...`, and `cargo test
   --workspace`.

### 5.2 Upgrade steps (per contract)

```sh
source .soroban-amm.deploy.env

# 1. Build and upload new WASM
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none
stellar contract upload --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/amm.wasm --network $NETWORK --source $SOURCE_ACCOUNT
# -> NEW_HASH=abc123...

# 2. Upgrade the live contract (admin auth required)
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK --source $ADMIN_ADDRESS -- upgrade --new_wasm_hash $NEW_HASH

# 3. Verify upgrade took — read back liveness and a known getter
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- get_info
# Or check the WASM hash via RPC if exposed; otherwise publish an `upgraded` event:
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- get_pool_count  # factory example

# 4. Persist the new hash locally
echo "export AMM_WASM_HASH=$NEW_HASH" >> .soroban-amm.deploy.env
```

For the **factory**, the upgrade path is:

```sh
# Upgrade factory bytecode itself
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- upgrade --new_wasm_hash $NEW_HASH
# Update future-pool WASM hashes (existing pools unaffected):
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- update_wasm_hashes --amm_wasm_hash $NEW_AMM_HASH --token_wasm_hash $NEW_TOKEN_HASH
```

### 5.3 Rolling back

Roll back by uploading the previous WASM and invoking `upgrade` again with its
hash. Keep the previous hash in `.soroban-amm.deploy.env` history or in git
tags:

```sh
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- upgrade --new_wasm_hash $PREVIOUS_HASH
```

There is no automatic rollback — the operator must manually re-invoke `upgrade`
with the old hash. Test upgrades on testnet first and keep a multisig
"time-delayed upgrade" proposal if the contract is governance-controlled (see
§6).

### 5.4 Who authorizes and how to verify

- **Direct admin:** `ADMIN_ADDRESS` key signs `upgrade`. Rotate via
  `propose_admin`/`accept_admin` (see §7).
- **Governance-controlled pools:** `execute` of a `ProposalKind::UpdateFee` or
  `UpdateFactoryGlobalFee` variant triggers the upgrade path — no direct admin
  call.
- **Verification:** After `upgrade`, call a read-only getter (`get_info`,
  `get_params`, `get_pool_count`) and confirm it still returns the expected
  state. Query the RPC for the `upgraded` event topic to audit the hash change.

### 5.5 Governance, concentrated liquidity, oracle aggregator and staking

These four contracts expose `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)`, following the same
explicit-`admin` convention as their other admin entrypoints (`pause`,
`propose_admin`, `set_protocol_fee`, ...):

1. The stored admin is read from instance storage (`DataKey::Admin`). An
   uninitialized contract returns its `NotInitialized` error.
2. The `admin` argument must equal the stored admin, otherwise the call fails
   with the contract's typed error (below). The contract is not modified.
3. `admin.require_auth()` — the admin key (or multisig account) must sign.
4. `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)` swaps the
   bytecode in place, and an `upgraded` event carrying the new hash is emitted.

| Contract | Admin set by | Wrong `admin` error |
|---|---|---|
| `governance` | `initialize(admin, ...)`; rotate with `propose_admin`/`accept_admin` | `GovernanceError::Unauthorized` (25) |
| `concentrated_liquidity` | `initialize(admin, ...)` (the factory admin for factory-created pools) | `ClError::Unauthorized` (12) |
| `oracle_aggregator` | `initialize(admin, ...)` | `OracleError::NotAdmin` (3) |
| `staking` | `initialize(..., admin)` | `StakingError::Unauthorized` (3) |

Authority is the single stored admin address of each contract. **Upgrades are
not voted on**: there is no governance `ProposalKind` for WASM upgrades, and
the `governance` contract's own upgrade is signed by its admin, not by LP
holders. For multi-party control, set the admin to a multisig account and
rotate it with `propose_admin`/`accept_admin` (§7).

`upgrade` never re-runs `initialize` and writes no storage, so admin,
configuration, proposals and votes, pool/tick/position state, oracle sources,
and stakes/locks/reward accounting all carry over unchanged. The new WASM must
read the same `DataKey` layout; any layout change needs its own migration.

```sh
source .soroban-amm.deploy.env

# Upload the new WASM (repeat per contract)
stellar contract upload --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/governance.wasm --network $NETWORK --source $SOURCE_ACCOUNT
# -> NEW_HASH=...

# Upgrade — the admin is passed explicitly and must sign
stellar contract invoke --id $GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK --source $ADMIN_ADDRESS -- upgrade --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS --new_wasm_hash $NEW_HASH
stellar contract invoke --id $CL_POOL_CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK --source $ADMIN_ADDRESS -- upgrade --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS --new_wasm_hash $NEW_HASH
stellar contract invoke --id $ORACLE_AGGREGATOR_CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK --source $ADMIN_ADDRESS -- upgrade --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS --new_wasm_hash $NEW_HASH
stellar contract invoke --id $STAKING_CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK --source $ADMIN_ADDRESS -- upgrade --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS --new_wasm_hash $NEW_HASH
```

Verify each upgrade by snapshotting state **before** the upgrade and comparing
it **after**:

| Contract | Read before and after |
|---|---|
| `governance` | `get_params`, `get_proposal_count`, `get_proposal --proposal_id <open id>` |
| `concentrated_liquidity` | `get_pool_state`, `get_tokens`, `fee_bps`, `get_position` for a known LP |
| `oracle_aggregator` | `get_admin`, `list_sources`, `get_max_staleness`, `get_max_deviation_bps` |
| `staking` | `get_pool_info`, `get_staker_info` / `pending_rewards` for a known staker |

Then confirm the `upgraded` event with `NEW_HASH` on the RPC, and roll back per
§5.3 if anything differs (pass `--admin` as above). The in-process test
`contracts/integration-tests/src/core_contract_upgrade_test.rs` checks this for
all four contracts: it swaps each one onto a different WASM, shows the new code
is running at the same address against the old storage, restores the original,
checks that all prior state matches and still works, and checks the typed
rejection of a non-admin caller.

### 5.6 Storage migrations and layout updates

#### 5.6.1 Token paged checkpoints (Issue #1074)
- **Problem addressed:** Previously, token balance changes rewrote an account's entire checkpoint vector in one persistent entry (`DataKey::Checkpoints(Address)`). This created two failures:
  1. Simulation/apply write byte count mismatch when an account had already transacted in the simulation ledger (overwrite branch vs append branch), triggering `ResourceLimitExceeded`.
  2. Write sizes grew linearly with history ($O(N)$), causing active pools to hit the network's `tx_max_write_bytes` (132 KB) around 880 checkpoints.
- **New storage layout:** Checkpoints are stored in fixed-size pages of 32 entries (`DataKey::CheckpointPage(Address, page)`), coordinated by `DataKey::CheckpointTracker(Address)`.
- **Properties:**
  - Storage writes touch only the current page and the tracker, ensuring $O(1)$ write byte count bounded by $\approx 2.3\text{ KB}$ regardless of history length.
  - No same-ledger coalescing: always append, ensuring write footprint and bytes are strictly identical between simulation and apply ledgers.
- **Upgrade and migration:**
  - For deployed tokens upgrading to the new WASM, `balance_at` falls back seamlessly to the legacy `DataKey::Checkpoints(Address)` entry for accounts not yet migrated.
  - On an account's first write (transfer, mint, or burn) post-upgrade, the contract automatically migrates legacy checkpoints into paged storage and removes the legacy entry. At the 1024 checkpoint cap, migration writes $\approx 74\text{ KB}$, well within the 132 KB transaction write limit.

#### 5.6.2 Concentrated liquidity fee growth scale (Issue #1098)
- **Problem addressed:** Concentrated liquidity previously tracked `fee_growth_global` and position fee growth using a fixed-point scale of $10^6$ (`1_000_000`). For realistic pool liquidities ($L \sim 10^{11} - 10^{15}$), any swap whose fee was smaller than $L / 10^6$ credited 0 growth, permanently locking fee dust.
- **New scale:** Switched to wide fixed-point scale $2^{64}$ (Q64, `FEE_GROWTH_SCALE = 1_i128 << 64`). Fee growth math uses 256-bit wide arithmetic (`mul_div`, `mul_wide`) to prevent overflow.
- **Parity:** Simulator (`packages/amm-simulator`) and contract use identical Q64 arithmetic and pass zero-tolerance parity tests.
- **Migration decision:** Pre-launch breaking change. Concentrated liquidity pools are redeployed with the new scale; existing pre-launch testnet pools should be re-created.

#### 5.6.3 POL vesting revocation semantics (Issue #1073)
- **Problem addressed:** `revoke_vesting` previously executed token transfers directly to both the treasury and the beneficiary. When invoked immediately after a `release` in the same ledger, simulation observed 0 unreleased vested tokens for the beneficiary (skipping the beneficiary transfer in the footprint), but applying in a later ledger attempted a positive transfer and trapped.
- **Resolution:**
  - `revoke_vesting` only ever transfers unvested tokens (`total - vested`) to the treasury. It never transfers directly to the beneficiary.
  - The schedule is frozen at the revocation ledger (`schedule.total = vested; schedule.revoked = true;`).
  - The beneficiary claims any vested-but-unreleased remainder via the standard `release` entrypoint.
  - Only treasury tokens are deducted from `Committed(lp_token)` on revoke; the beneficiary remainder remains committed until released.

## 6. Emergency Procedures

### 6.1 Pausing a pool

```sh
# Anyone with admin auth can pause — halts swaps, add/remove liquidity, flash loans
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- pause --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS
# Check:
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- is_paused
# -> true

# Resume:
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- unpause --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS
```

The CL pool has the same `pause`/`unpause` interface. Factory pools can be
paused individually; there is no global factory pause except `pause_creation`
which blocks `create_pool`/`create_cl_pool`.

**Who can pause:** The pool's stored `admin` (factory admin or governance
contract). Governance-controlled pools require a governance proposal to pause;
direct admin `pause` is blocked when governance is set.

### 6.2 Circuit-breaker auto-pause and recovery

The AMM's `check_circuit_breaker` runs on every `swap`/`add_liquidity`:

- Captures `spot_price = reserve_b * 1_000_000 / reserve_a` at the start of
  each ledger (`CircuitBreakerLastPrice` + `LastSeqno`).
- On the same ledger, if `|current_price - baseline| * 10000 / baseline >=
  threshold_bps`, the pool **auto-pauses** and stores
  `CircuitBreakerTriggeredAt = now`, emitting `circuit_break`.
- Sub-calls revert with `CircuitBreaker (15)`.

**Recovery:**

```sh
# Wait at least cooldown seconds (default 600s == 10 min) after trigger
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- get_circuit_breaker_config
# -> { threshold_bps: 5000, cooldown_secs: 600, triggered_at: 1714000000, tripped: true }

stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- try_circuit_breaker_recovery
# -> true if cooldown elapsed and pool was tripped; reverts otherwise

# Admin can also unpause directly without waiting (governance review path):
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- unpause --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS

# Tune threshold/cooldown (admin-only):
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- set_circuit_breaker_config --threshold_bps 3000 --cooldown_secs 1800
```

**Who can do each:** `try_circuit_breaker_recovery` is permissionless after
cooldown; `set_circuit_breaker_config` and direct `unpause` require admin.

### 6.3 Multisig emergency withdrawal (k-of-n)

When `set_multisig(signers, quorum)` has been called on the AMM pool, the
single-admin `emergency_withdraw` path is **disabled** — funds can only be
moved via the multisig flow:

```sh
# 1. A signer proposes the recipient
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- propose_emergency_withdraw --signer $SIGNER_A --recipient $SAFE_ADDRESS

# 2. Other signers approve the same recipient (each calls the same function — approvals accumulate)
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- propose_emergency_withdraw --signer $SIGNER_B --recipient $SAFE_ADDRESS
# ... until approvals >= quorum

# 3. Any signer executes once quorum is reached and before expiry (7 days)
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- exec_multisig_emergency_wd --signer $SIGNER_A

# 4. Verify
stellar contract invoke --id $AMM_POOL_CONTRACT_ID -- get_multisig_proposal
# Reserves are zeroed; TotalShares reset; MinLiquidityLocked cleared so deposits can resume
```

**Expiry:** Proposals expire `MULTISIG_PROPOSAL_TTL_SECS = 7 days` after the
`propose` timestamp. Re-proposing with the same signer before expiry does
**not** extend the TTL (fix for indefinite-stalling attack) — only a new
approver extends the window.

**Who can do each:** Only addresses in `signers` Vec; `quorum` of them must
approve. `AlreadyExecuted (19)` / `ProposalExpired (20)` are returned on
double-execute or late execute.

### 6.4 Factory creation pause

```sh
# Pause new pool creation (does not affect existing pools)
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- pause_creation --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS
# Resume
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- unpause_creation --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS
# Check
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- is_creation_paused
```

Use during an active incident to prevent attackers from creating pools with
manipulated fees while the root cause is investigated.

---

## 7. Admin Key Management

Every contract uses a **two-step `propose_admin` / `accept_admin`** rotation —
there is no single-transaction admin steal. The pattern is identical across
`token`, `amm`, `factory`, `oracle_aggregator`, `batch_auction`, etc.

### 7.1 Rotation procedure

```sh
# 1. Current admin nominates the new admin
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID -- propose_admin --current_admin $OLD --new_admin $NEW

# 2. New admin must accept from its own key (require_auth on $NEW)
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID -- accept_admin --new_admin $NEW \
  --source $NEW_KEY

# Verify:
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID -- admin   # or get_admin / get_info
```

If step 2 is not completed, the nomination sits as `PendingAdmin` and the old
admin remains in control. Calling `accept_admin` with a wrong address reverts
`WrongAdmin (13)`; calling without a pending nomination reverts
`NoPendingAdmin (12)`.

**Protocol-wide rotation** — repeat for every pool the factory has deployed,
plus each auxiliary contract. Enumerate with `get_pool_count` +
`get_pools(offset, limit)` (and `get_cl_pool_count` + `get_cl_pools` for CL
pools). Do **not** drive the loop off `all_pools()`: it is capped at 200
entries (issue #790) and silently truncates past that, which would leave the
pools beyond the cap still under the old admin. Use `scripts/deploy.sh --only
<contract>` or a script loop:

```sh
source .soroban-amm.deploy.env
page=50
count=$(stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID -- get_pool_count)
for ((offset = 0; offset < count; offset += page)); do
  pools=$(stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID \
    -- get_pools --offset "$offset" --limit "$page" | grep -Eo 'C[A-Z0-9]{55}')
  for pool in $pools; do
    echo "Rotating $pool"
    stellar contract invoke --id $pool -- propose_admin --current_admin $OLD --new_admin $NEW --source $OLD
    stellar contract invoke --id $pool -- accept_admin --new_admin $NEW --source $NEW
  done
done
```

### 7.2 Multisig configuration

- **AMM multisig:** `set_multisig(signers Vec<Address>, quorum u32)` on the
  pool. Set `quorum=0` to disable multisig (single-admin mode). Changing the
  config clears any pending `MultisigProposal`.
- **Governance veto multisig:** `set_veto_multisig(multisig Address)` on
  governance. Within `VETO_WINDOW_SECS=86400` after a proposal's `vote_end`,
  the veto multisig can `veto(proposal_id)` to mark it `ProposalVetoed (28)`.
- **Factory treasury:** `set_treasury(admin, treasury Address, global_protocol_fee_bps)` — makes the factory the `fee_recipient` for all factory pools, then `sweep_fees(token)` (permissionless) forwards accrued fees to treasury. Rotate treasury via `propose_treasury`/`accept_treasury` if exposed.
- **LP token `set_locker`:** Governance is the locker; if governance is upgraded, rotate locker via `set_locker(new_governance)`. The fix for issue #556 ensures old locker entries remain unlockable by the locker that originally locked them.

**Recommendation:** Use a multisig (e.g. 3-of-5) for all `admin` roles on
mainnet. Single-key admins are appropriate only on testnet.

---

## 8. Network-Specific Notes

### Testnet

- Friendbot funds any new keypair; `stellar keys fund --network testnet` works.
- RPC `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` may rate-limit under load — retry
  with exponential backoff; `scripts/deploy.sh` does not retry automatically.
- Storage rent is lower; deploys are cheap — use testnet for all rehearsal
  runs before mainnet.
- Run `scripts/e2e.sh` on testnet after `scripts/deploy.sh` to smoke-test
  swaps, liquidity, and factory discovery.
- WASM uploads and deploys are fast; the `--fund` flag on `keys generate` is
  sufficient.

### Mainnet

- No Friendbot — the deployer must be funded before running the script.
  Transfer at least 20–30 XLM for a full protocol deployment to cover transaction
  fees and contract instance storage rent.
- Use `--network mainnet` and `--source mainnet-deployer` (a dedicated,
  hardware-wallet-backed key if possible).
- Double-check all recommended parameters before mainnet — especially `fee_bps`,
  `protocol_fee_bps`, `voting_period`, `quorum_bps`, and `max_staleness`.
  Parameter regressions on mainnet require governance proposals or coordinated
  `upgrade` calls.
- The Stellar CLI network passphrase for mainnet is `Public Global Stellar
  Network ; September 2015` — verify `stellar network add mainnet` uses the
  correct RPC and passphrase.
- Consider `make optimize` before upload — optimized binaries reduce storage
  rent (20–40% smaller).
- Deploy on mainnet with `--only` increments and verify each increment before
  proceeding, rather than a single full-protocol run — this limits blast radius
  of a failed batch.
- Keep `ADMIN_ADDRESS` as a multisig contract address from day one on mainnet;
  single-key admin on mainnet is an existential risk.

### Local / standalone

- Use `stellar network add local --rpc-url http://localhost:8000 ...` with
  `stellar network` or `soroban` quickstart.
- Fund the deployer via the local Friendbot or `stellar keys fund`.

## 9. Failure Modes & Error Codes

Cross-reference `docs/error-codes.md` for the full discriminant table. Common
operator-facing failures and their fixes:

### AMM (`AmmError`)

| Code | Variant | Operator action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | AlreadyInitialized | `initialize` called twice — deploy is idempotent; re-run verification instead. |
| 2 | InvalidFeeBps | `fee_bps` out of `[0,10000]` or `protocol_fee_bps >= fee_bps`. Fix param and redeploy or `update_fee`. |
| 4 | DeadlineExceeded | `deadline < ledger.timestamp`. Increase deadline (caller should set `now + 300`). |
| 5 | SlippageExceeded | `amount_out < min_out` or `amount_in > max_in`. Widen slippage or pre-quote with `get_amount_out`. |
| 6 | Paused | Pool is paused (admin or circuit breaker). Check `is_paused` / `get_circuit_breaker_config`. |
| 11 | InsufficientLiquidity | Swap or remove larger than reserves. Fund pool or reduce amount. |
| 14 | Reentrant | Receiver callback re-entered the pool — fix receiver contract, not the pool. |
| 15 | CircuitBreaker | Price moved >threshold in one ledger. See §6.2 recovery. |
| 18 | FlashLoanRepaymentFailed | Receiver did not return `amount + fee` — fix `on_flash_loan` implementation. |
| 19/20 | AlreadyExecuted / ProposalExpired | Multisig proposal lifecycle error — re-propose. |

### Factory (`FactoryError`)

| Code | Variant | Operator action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | AlreadyInitialized | Factory already `initialize`d — skip or verify `get_pool_count`. |
| 3 | PoolAlreadyExists | Pair already has a pool — query `get_pool` instead of creating. |
| 4 | ClPoolAlreadyExists | Same triplet exists — query `get_cl_pool`. |
| 5 | ClWasmNotSet | Call `set_cl_wasm_hash` before `create_cl_pool`. |
| 6 | Unauthorized | Not the factory `admin` (or not permissionless caller). Use correct `admin` key. |
| 8 | RateLimitExceeded | `LastPoolCreation` within `RateLimitLedgers`. Wait or lower rate limit via `set_rate_limit`. |
| 9 | CreationPaused | `pause_creation` is active — `unpause_creation`. |

### Governance (`GovernanceError`)

| Code | Variant | Operator action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 8 | InsufficientStake | Proposer holds < `min_proposer_stake_bps` of LP supply. Increase holdings or lower threshold via `set_min_proposer_stake_bps`. |
| 9 | ProposalNotFound | `proposal_id` does not exist — check `proposal_status`. |
| 11 | VotingPeriodEnded | Vote window closed — new proposal required. |
| 19 | QuorumNotMet | `for_votes / total_supply < quorum_bps/10000`. Wait for more voters or lower quorum. |
| 28 | ProposalVetoed | Veto multisig rejected — cannot be re-executed. |
| 34 | PartialFactoryUpdate | `UpdateFactoryGlobalFee` window (`offset/limit`) did not cover all pools — re-propose with full window. |

### Token (panic messages, not enumerants)

| Message | Operator action |
|---------|-----------------|
| `already initialized: contract ...` | `initialize` called twice — skip. |
| `insufficient allowance: ...` | `approve` with higher `amount` / later `live_until_ledger`. |
| `live_until_ledger must be >= current ledger` | Approval expired — re-approve with `live_until_ledger >= ledger.sequence`. |
| `insufficient unlocked balance: ...` | Tokens locked by governance vote — call `unlock` after proposal concludes. |
| `current_admin is not admin` | Wrong `current_admin` in `propose_admin`. |
| `not pending admin` | Wrong `new_admin` in `accept_admin`. |

### CL (`ClError`)

| Code | Meaning | Operator action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 4 | TickOutOfRange | `tick ∉ [-887272, 887272]` |
| 13 | TickNotAligned | Tick not multiple of `tick_spacing` — adjust tick bounds. |
| 16 | InvalidToken | `token_in` not in pool's pair. |
| 18 | OracleDeviationExceeded | Swap vs. oracle price > `MaxOracleDeviationBps` — check aggregator sources. |
| 19 | NftNotConfigured | `set_position_nft` not called — wire NFT contract. |

For the full discriminant table see `docs/error-codes.md`.

## 10. Deployment Script Reference

### Quick start

```sh
# Full protocol to testnet (resumable, idempotent, verified)
scripts/deploy.sh testnet

# Only the core path (factory + pools + governance)
scripts/deploy.sh --only factory,pools,governance

# Incremental: deploy one contract
scripts/deploy.sh --only staking

# Redeploy after a failed run (without --force the completed steps are no-ops)
scripts/deploy.sh testnet   # resumes
scripts/deploy.sh testnet --force  # re-does everything

# Skip governance-dependent contracts
scripts/deploy.sh --skip governance,staking,incentive_campaigns

# Mainnet (explicit source and network)
NETWORK=mainnet SOURCE_ACCOUNT=mainnet-deployer scripts/deploy.sh --force
```

Every deployable contract in the workspace has a module in `scripts/deploy/`
and a step in `ALL_CONTRACTS` (`scripts/deploy/common.sh`), which is also the
list `deploy.sh` loads its modules from. `scripts/check_deploy_scripts.sh`
(`make check-deploy-scripts`, run in CI) fails when a contract crate has no
module, is missing from `ALL_CONTRACTS`, or is never called from `main()`.

### Env file contract

All state is persisted to `.soroban-amm.deploy.env` (overridable via
`$DEPLOY_ENV`) as `export KEY='value'` lines — **every address and initialization
marker is written immediately after it succeeds**, so:

- **Killing the script mid-deployment and re-running resumes** rather than
  restarting. Demonstrate:

  ```sh
  scripts/deploy.sh testnet & pid=$!
  sleep 5; kill $pid
  cat .soroban-amm.deploy.env   # partial addresses persisted
  scripts/deploy.sh testnet      # resumes from where it left off
  ```

- **Re-running a completed deployment is a no-op** without `--force`:

  ```sh
  scripts/deploy.sh testnet           # second run: all steps print "skipping ... already at ..."
  scripts/deploy.sh testnet --force   # re-deploys and re-initializes
  ```

- **Every deployed address is persisted as it is created**, not at the end.

- **A failure prints which contract and which step failed**:

  ```
  [deploy][error] failed at contract=factory step=initialize factory (exit 1)
  ```

### Reusing helpers in other scripts (e.g. `scripts/e2e.sh`)

All `scripts/deploy/*.sh` modules are **sourceable**. To extend `scripts/e2e.sh`
or write a custom integration script:

```sh
ROOT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"
NETWORK=testnet
DEPLOY_ENV="$ROOT_DIR/.soroban-amm.e2e.env"
source "$ROOT_DIR/scripts/deploy/common.sh"
source "$ROOT_DIR/scripts/deploy/token.sh"
# Now call deploy_tokens, invoke, persist_var, etc.
```

Keep deploy helpers importable — do not inline their logic into `main`
(see `Coordination` in the deploy issue).

### Out of scope

The deploy script does **not** modify `scripts/e2e.sh`, CI workflows, or
contract source — those are owned by other issues. Contract size reports and
optimizer scripts (`scripts/size_report.sh`, `scripts/optimize_contracts.sh`)
are also untouched.
