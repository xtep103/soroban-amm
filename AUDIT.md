### 2.1 Critical

No critical issues identified.

---

### 2.2 High

No open high-severity findings. H-01 is resolved (see §2.6).

---

### 2.3 Medium

#### M-03 — `initialize` accepts `protocol_fee_bps == fee_bps`

**Location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:381`, in `initialize_with_flash_loan_fee` (`initialize` delegates to it)
**Description:** The M-02 fix made `set_protocol_fee` reject a value of
`protocol_fee_bps` that is equal to or greater than `fee_bps`. The initializer
still validates with `(0..=fee_bps).contains(&protocol_fee_bps)`, which allows
equality. A pool created with `protocol_fee_bps == fee_bps > 0` sends 100% of
swap fees to the protocol and none to LPs, which is the situation M-02 was
meant to prevent. The admin can only move away from that setting later through
`set_protocol_fee`.
**Recommendation:** Apply the same strict bound as `set_protocol_fee` in the
initializer: `protocol_fee_bps < fee_bps` when `fee_bps > 0`, and
`protocol_fee_bps == 0` when `fee_bps == 0`.
**Status:** Open.

---

#### M-04 — Emergency guard disableable by the admin it guards; withdrawals had no pause precondition or delay

**Location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs` — `emergency_withdraw`, `set_multisig`,
`propose_emergency_withdraw`, `exec_multisig_emergency_wd`, and the new
`announce_emergency_withdraw` / `cancel_emergency_withdraw`.
**Description:** The emergency path moves every reserve out of the pool. Two
layers were supposed to constrain it: a k-of-n multisig guard and a timed
governance proposal. Neither constrained the key it existed to constrain.
`set_multisig(admin, [], 0)` required only the stored admin's authorization, and
the single-admin `emergency_withdraw` refused only while `MultisigQuorum > 0`.
A single admin could therefore disable the guard and drain the pool in the same
ledger. The same admin could instead install signers it controlled with
`quorum = 1`. `emergency_withdraw` had no pause precondition and no delay, and
`exec_multisig_emergency_wd` executed as soon as quorum was reached. Accrued
protocol fees were left behind by both paths, and several failures returned
misleading error variants (`InsufficientShares`, `NoPendingAdmin`,
`InvalidFeeBps`).
**Fix:** The guard is now tamper-resistant. While `MultisigQuorum > 0`,
`set_multisig` may only be changed through the multisig itself (propose,
approve, execute at the same quorum) or after a timelock; lowering `quorum` to
0 is never a single-key action. Single-admin emergency withdrawals are
announced with `announce_emergency_withdraw(to)` and succeed only after
`EMERGENCY_DELAY_SECS` (configurable at `initialize`, default 24 h, capped at
7 days) and only while the pool is paused; `cancel_emergency_withdraw` clears
the announcement and a second `announce` restarts the delay. The same delay
applies to `exec_multisig_emergency_wd`, measured from quorum being reached.
Both paths reject `to == env.current_contract_address()` and `to == lp_token`
and sweep accrued fees to `to`. New `QuorumNotReached`, `NoPendingProposal` and
`InvalidQuorum` error variants replace the misleading ones (appended, not
renumbered). Versioned announce/cancel/execute events include the amounts
moved. Governance's `EmergencyWithdraw` proposal kind still works: its
execution calls `emergency_withdraw` after its own timelock, and that call must
also satisfy the new announcement delay (governance-originated calls do not
skip the announcement).
**Status:** Fixed.

### 2.4 Low

#### L-02 — Imbalanced deposits accept excess tokens without refund

**Location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:1552` — `add_liquidity` (doc comment at line 1533)
**Description:** When a deposit is imbalanced, shares are minted at the
minimum ratio and the excess tokens remain in the pool, effectively donating
them to existing LPs. The function does not refund excess.
**Recommendation:** Document this behavior prominently in the function docs
and recommend callers compute optimal amounts off-chain before depositing.
**Status:** Acknowledged (by design, documented). The `add_liquidity` doc
comment says excess tokens are "**not** refunded automatically" and tells
callers to compute amounts off-chain.

---

### 2.5 Informational

#### I-02 — No event emitted by `add_liquidity` for first deposit

**Location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:1552` — `add_liquidity`
**Description:** The `add_liquidity` event is published for all deposits, but
the first deposit (which sets the pool price) has no distinct event that indexers
can use to detect initial price discovery. As of `74d227f` there is still no
`init_price` (or equivalent) event. The first-deposit branch at line 1600 only
locks `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY`.
**Recommendation:** Emit a separate `init_price` event on the first deposit.
**Status:** Open (informational).

### 2.6 Resolved findings

These findings are kept for their history. Each entry gives the original
finding, the change that fixed it, and where the fix is in the source at
`74d227f`, so a reader can check the fix directly. The PR numbers are the first
upstream merge that contained the fixing commit.

#### H-01 — `initialize` ignores `admin`, `fee_recipient`, and `protocol_fee_bps` — **Fixed**

**Original finding:** `initialize` delegated to `initialize_with_flash_loan_fee`
and passed only `token_a`, `token_b`, `lp_token` and `fee_bps`. The values of
`admin`, `fee_recipient` and `protocol_fee_bps` were silently dropped.
**Fix:** `94fbf5d` ("fix AMM contract compilation errors", merged via #85).
`initialize` now forwards all eight arguments.
**Current location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:336` (`initialize`) forwards
to `initialize_with_flash_loan_fee` at line 361. That function stores `Admin`,
`FeeRecipient` and `ProtocolFeeBps`.
**Residual:** the initializer's protocol-fee bound is not as strict as the one
in `set_protocol_fee`. This is tracked as M-03.

#### M-01 — No re-entrancy guard on `flash_loan` — **Fixed**

**Original finding:** a flash-loan callback could re-enter `swap` or
`add_liquidity` while reserves were in an inconsistent state.
**Fix:** `525d0d6` added reentrancy guards (merged via #285). `c80c12d` then
extended the guard to every fund-moving entry point (merged via #778).
**Current location:** the RAII `ReentrancyGuard` over `DataKey::Locked` is at
`contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:263–303`. Guards are acquired in `flash_loan` (line
2360), `add_liquidity` (1571), `remove_liquidity` (1704),
`remove_liquidity_one_sided` (1806), `swap` (2022), `swap_exact_out` (2184),
`withdraw_protocol_fees` (2306) and `emergency_withdraw` (518). A reentrant call
returns `AmmError::Reentrant` (line 82). The lock state can be read through
`is_locked` / `flash_loan_locked` (lines 601, 608).

#### M-02 — `set_protocol_fee` allows admin to set `protocol_fee_bps == fee_bps` — **Fixed**

**Original finding:** `protocol_fee_bps <= fee_bps` let the admin send the
whole swap fee to the protocol, leaving nothing for LPs.
**Fix:** `9783353` (merged via #454). The bound is now strict, and a
`protocol_fee_set` event is emitted on every change so LPs and indexers can
monitor it.
**Current location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:850` — `set_protocol_fee` (the
check follows the `// Fix M-02` comment).
**Residual:** `initialize` still allows equality. This is tracked as M-03.

#### M-04 — Emergency guard disableable by the admin it guards; withdrawals had no pause precondition or delay — **Fixed**

**Original finding:** `set_multisig(admin, [], 0)` required only the stored
admin's authorization, and `emergency_withdraw` refused only while
`MultisigQuorum > 0`, so a single admin could disable the guard and drain the
pool in the same ledger. `emergency_withdraw` had no pause precondition and no
delay, and `exec_multisig_emergency_wd` executed as soon as quorum was reached.
Accrued protocol fees were left behind, and several failures returned
misleading error variants.
**Fix:** The guard can only be changed through the multisig (or after a
timelock) while `MultisigQuorum > 0`. Single-admin withdrawals require a prior
`announce_emergency_withdraw` and a paused pool, and wait
`EMERGENCY_DELAY_SECS` (default 24 h, capped at 7 days). The multisig path
waits the same delay from quorum. Both paths sweep accrued fees and reject
`to == pool` and `to == lp_token`. New `QuorumNotReached`,
`NoPendingProposal` and `InvalidQuorum` variants were appended.
**Status:** Fixed.

#### L-01 — `withdraw_protocol_fees` missing closing brace causes dead code — **Fixed**

**Original finding:** at `66a4643`, `withdraw_protocol_fees` ended at the
`(fee_a, fee_b)` return with no closing `}`, so `flash_loan` appeared nested
inside it.
**Fix:** `94fbf5d` (merged via #85) added the missing brace.
**Current location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:2303` — `withdraw_protocol_fees`
is well-formed and closes after `Ok((fee_a, fee_b))`. `flash_loan` is a
separate method at line 2360. The function has also since gained the
reentrancy guard (M-01) and a typed `NotInitialized` error.

#### L-03 — `pause` and `unpause` do not validate the caller against stored admin — **Fixed**

**Original finding:** `pause(env, admin)` / `unpause(env, admin)` called
`require_auth` on the address passed in and never checked the stored admin.
**Fix:** `d0c0688` ("enforce admin auth", merged via #113). The `admin`
parameter was removed, and both functions now load the stored admin and require
its authorization.
**Current location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:493` (`pause`) and `:501`
(`unpause`). Both call `Self::read_admin(&env)?` and then `admin.require_auth()`.

#### I-01 — TWAP accumulators can overflow for long-lived pools — **Addressed**

**Original finding:** the `i128` price accumulators could in theory overflow.
The overflow horizon was about 1.6 × 10¹⁷ years, so this was not an immediate
concern.
**Fix:** `f2f7f4d` (merged via #170) switched to `wrapping_add`, which follows
the recommendation. Overflow is now defined behavior, and consumers take
differences of cumulative values.
**Current location:** `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:1478–1479` in `checkpoint_twap`
(line 1454).

## 3. Outstanding review scope: concentrated liquidity

`contracts/concentrated_liquidity/src/lib.rs` (9,463 lines at `74d227f`) is the
main Phase 2 component. **It has not had a security review.** The property
results in §4 do not cover it.

Recent correctness fixes show why this contract needs its own review:

- `035ebc1` / `9ba37a0`: tick-crossing and burn bugs (#785, #786), merged via #807
- `cc1c262`: mint amount/liquidity mismatch and a swap precision underflow, merged via #784
- `70627c5`: swaps are now priced in Q64.96 to fix per-token insolvency, merged via #898
- `4c3ff82`: added a deadline parameter to `mint_position`, merged via #879
- `51d1a69`: new `swap_exact_out` pricing path using reverse tick-walking math

## 4. Property-Based Testing Summary

The fuzz suite in `contracts/amm-fuzz/src/lib.rs` verified the following
constant-product properties over **10 000 random cases each**. These results
apply to `contracts/amm/src/lib.rs` only and are not evidence that the
concentrated-liquidity contract has the same invariant.

| Property | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Output < reserve_out for all valid inputs | PASS |
| Output ≥ 0 for all valid inputs | PASS |
| Output is monotone in amount_in | PASS |
| Effective rate is non-increasing as amount_in grows | PASS |
| Fee amount is bounded in [0, amount_in] | PASS |
| Zero-fee output equals pure CP formula (±1 rounding) | PASS |
| 100% fee yields zero output | PASS |
| k = reserve_in × reserve_out never decreases after a swap | PASS |
| get_amount_in is right-inverse of get_amount_out (±2 rounding) | PASS |

All regression cases pinned in the `regression` module also pass.

## 6. Conclusion

The constant-product AMM review found the x*y=k invariant holding across the
fee tiers exercised by the fuzz suite. As of `74d227f`, all of the original
high, medium and low findings for that pool are fixed or acknowledged. One
medium finding (M-03, the residual initializer gap from M-02) and one
informational item (I-02) remain open.

The emergency path was hardened after `74d227f` (M-04): the k-of-n guard can no
longer be disabled by the admin it guards, and emergency withdrawals now
require a pause and an announced delay. See §2.6.

The concentrated-liquidity contract has not been reviewed. The surfaces in §3
must be reviewed before that contract handles significant value. Read this
document as a scoped review of the constant-product pool, not as a claim that
the whole workspace is sound.
