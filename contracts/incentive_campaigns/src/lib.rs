#![no_std]

//! Governance-controlled trading incentive campaigns for liquidity providers.
//!
//! Supports multiple simultaneous time-based campaigns, multiple reward tokens,
//! proportional LP distribution, and a full on-chain audit trail.
//!
//! ## Reward accounting (MasterChef-style accumulator — fix for #425)
//!
//! The original implementation computed rewards as:
//!   `provider_share = reward_rate * elapsed * lp_balance / total_supply`
//!
//! That formula applies the provider's *current* LP balance retroactively to the
//! entire elapsed window since campaign start, so a late joiner who flash-deposited
//! just before claiming could steal a large share of previously accrued rewards.
//! `set_campaign_rate` had the same flaw — changing the rate rewrote the entire
//! history.
//!
//! The fix uses a **per-second accumulator** (`acc_reward_per_share`) that ticks
//! forward continuously at `reward_rate / total_supply` per second (scaled by
//! `PRECISION = 1_000_000_000_000` to preserve sub-unit precision in integer
//! arithmetic).  Each provider stores the accumulator value at their last claim
//! (`acc_at_snapshot`).  On claim:
//!
//!   `pending = lp_balance * (acc_now − acc_at_snapshot) / PRECISION`
//!
//! A flash depositor who claims in the same second as their deposit sees
//! `acc_now ≈ acc_at_snapshot` and earns essentially nothing.  An honest LP who
//! held for the full campaign window earns exactly their time-weighted share.
//!
//! `set_campaign_rate` flushes the accumulator to the current timestamp before
//! updating the rate, so past accruals are locked in at the old rate and only
//! future seconds use the new rate.
//!
//! ## Stake-based campaigns (fix for #1115)
//!
//! The accumulator above was still fed by data this contract cannot observe over
//! time: the LP token's live `total_supply` and each provider's live balance. A
//! provider was only registered by their first `claim_rewards`, so a passive
//! provider's first claim paid 0, and anyone could reprice an idle window by
//! temporarily changing the LP supply right before the next touch.
//!
//! Campaigns created from now on are **stake-based**. Providers `stake` their LP
//! tokens into this contract and `unstake` them again. The contract therefore
//! sees every change to the staked amount as it happens:
//!
//! * the accumulator divides by the campaign's own `total_staked`, which is only
//!   ever changed by `stake` / `unstake`, so each interval is priced at the stake
//!   that existed over it;
//! * `stake`, `unstake` and `set_campaign_rate` all advance the accumulator to
//!   "now" *before* they change anything, so no third party can reprice another
//!   provider's interval;
//! * a position that stays staked for the whole window receives its exact share
//!   on its first claim, however late that claim is made;
//! * seconds with zero stake accrue to nobody and stay in
//!   `funding_amount - total_distributed`, which `recover_leftover_funds` returns.
//!
//! Campaigns that existed before the upgrade have no stake marker and keep
//! running under the old live-balance rules (see `docs/incentive-campaigns.md`).
